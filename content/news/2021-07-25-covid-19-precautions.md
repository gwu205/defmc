In light of the current COVID-19 situation, please be assured that the highest standards of hygiene are maintained in our clinics as always. All patients are requested to stay in their cars until they are ready to be seen so as to reduce their time of stay in the waiting room. We have improved our waiting space to allow for adequate social distancing between waiting patients.

We have introduced telemedicine to anyone who may need be having potential infective symptoms and anyone else who finds it necessary to have remote access consultations.

鑑於當前的COVID-19情況，請放心我們會一如既往保持最高的衛生標準。 我們會要求全部候診人士留在自己的車內等候，直到醫生准備好然后直接進入房間進行諮詢，以減少他們在候診室的停留時間。 我們亦已經改善了對等待空間的利用，以報証等待患者之間的安全距離。

我們已開始提供需要在線諮詢的任何人介紹遠程醫療。
