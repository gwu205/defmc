In light of the current COVID-19 situation, please be assured that the highest standards of hygiene are maintained in our clinics as always. All patients are requested to stay in their cars until they are ready to be seen so as to reduce their time of stay in the waiting room. We have improved our waiting space to allow for adequate social distancing between waiting patients.

We have introduced telemedicine to anyone who may need be having potential infective symptoms and anyone else who finds it necessary to have remote access consultations.

鑑於當前的COVID-19情況，請放心我們一如既往最高衛生標準。 任何具有潛在感染症狀的患者都被要求盡量呆在自己的車內，直到將他們直接帶到單獨的房間進行諮詢，以減少他們在候診室的停留時間。 我們已經改善了對等待空間的利用，以使等待患者之間的距離更好。

我們正在為可能在不久的將來需要在線諮詢的任何人介紹遠程醫療。

我們還將介紹流感疫苗接種診所，以在特定時間為好病患者提供疫苗接種，以減少他們與其他患者的接觸。

請密切注意這個空間。
